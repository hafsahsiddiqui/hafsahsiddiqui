## Hi there 👋

Hi! I am student studying Management Information Systems (MIS) with a minor in Marketing at The University of Texas at Austin. I am passionate about project management, machine learning, data science, and data analytics and have experience applying Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Power BI, and more through my in-class projects. Through my internships and leadership experience, I learned how to execute marketing campaigns as well as how to act as a consultant with a client. I am currently looking for a full-time job opportunity that would allow me to leverage my analytical and engineering skills to help make data-driven decisions.

Advanced features like visitor counts, clickable icons, etc. (Note: you may need to do some research to learn how to implement these features)
